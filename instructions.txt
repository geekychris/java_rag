Implement me a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) service.  This service should be written in springboot java.  Use springboot ai for integrating with llama or other models. For this moment using local llama is sufficient.  The vector db in this case should be a local OpenSearch service on http://localhost:30920.  The service should have a rest interface and allow management of a rag index.  It should allow me to provide a csv file of documents where each row is a document.  The service should compute the embeddings for indexing and provide retrieval.  Include tests and example documents.  Create a document that describes the architecture and how to build and run.
